The National Energy Authority (NEA) has conducted a feasibility of the area to determine the energy sources available in the district for off-grid electrification. This initiative aligns with the government's Energy Vision 2030, which aims to provide 70% of households with access to clean and reliable energy. This report covers the study conducted by the projects team for the possible 150kW solar system at Esa\u2019ala station.</span></p>",
