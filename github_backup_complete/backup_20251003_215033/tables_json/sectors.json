More than 10,000 species of fish, molluscs and crustaceans have so far been identified.</p><p>&nbsp;Coastal commercial fishing is&nbsp;based primarily on prawns, lobster and baramundi and a collection of sedentary fisheries resources, including beche-de-mer, trochus shells, pearl shell and green snail. The operations are carried out by small-scale commercial fishermen, who sell their product to a range of small to medium sized fish processing and marketing entrepreneurs. Sea cucumber is collected and processed for export. The trade in shells with lustrous interiors is small, but growing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Domestic private investment in commercial fisheries in Papua New Guinea is small. Inland fish production is still very much underdeveloped, but commercial farming of trout and carp has been undertaken by a few farmers in the Highlands region of the country. The Papua New Guinea government is exploring avenues for the privatization of various aspects of its coastal fisheries programme.</p><p>&nbsp;Private sector participation is encouraged in the areas of handling, processing and marketing of marine products, craft construction, repairs and maintenance, engine sales and ice and fishing equipment sales. The Government is also playing a key role in the management of the fishing industry. The long-term sustainability of the resources and the environmental impact are the key factors for the long-term sustainability, growth and development of the fisheries sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The major emphasis of the Government is the development of industrial and commercial fisheries which will help to provide the infrastructure necessary from small and medium scale fisheries development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.fisheries.gov.pg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PNG&nbsp;National Fisheries Authority</a> is the primary regulatory and management body for the sector and it provides support and coordinate fishery development in the country.

The respective Provincial Forest Management Committees contribute to the decisions relating to the management of the forest resource within the provinces. The <a href=\"http://www.fiapng.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Papua New Guinea Forest Industry Association Inc.

Of these 39 million hectares,&nbsp;15 million hectares of high quality tropical hardwoods are considered to be suitable for development. The State has acquired 12 million hectares from the 15 million hectares,&nbsp;of which 10 million hectares have been allocated under timber permits.</p><p>The Government is mindful of its obligations to environmental heritage when promoting the forest resource. Each major investment project is carefully evaluated in terms of its environmental impact and every effort is made to develop appropriate guidelines to meet the needs of both the local people and the investors.</p><p>&nbsp;The Government's recognition of the value of rare and magnificent natural forest has resulted in major policy changes aimed at creating an environment for sustainable downstream processing activities. International markets are establishing requirements for all tropical wood products to come from forest plantations and afforested sourced areas. With Papua New Guinea reforming its forestry policy to meet the international requirements particularly in already clear felled areas and savanna grasslands, it will be well-equipped to provide sound and rewarding&nbsp;investment opportunities.</p><p>In the forestry sub-sector, products made of tropical hardwood attract top prices. Although markets do exist, few are efficiently supplied at present, so the ability to establish a constant customer supply will guarantee a permanent and high demand.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Investment in the Infrastructure Sector</strong></p><p>The rehabilitation and maintenance of the transport infrastructure is an important priority for the national government, due to the crucial role that the transport infrastructure plays in facilitating improved access to goods and services. In recent years the Government has invested substantial budgetary support towards building and improving public infrastructure throughout the country, including regular maintenance and upkeep of the transport infrastructure.</p><p>Three sectors of infrastructure within the context of transport are presented beginning with the relevant policy frameworks (plans and vision) followed by a discussion of the sectors as follows: roads and road transport; maritime and inland water transport; and air transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sector Profile in PNG</strong></p><p>The vision of the transport sector by the Government is to have \u201ca well-integrated, competitive, affordable, financially and environmentally sustainable transport system\u201d. In order to achieve this vision a number of goals are to be achieved, amongst others, the following: \u201crestore the national transport network; develop new infrastructure where economically viable and within financial and capacity constraints; bring 95% of the population within easy reach of all-weather transport access; and provide transport access to 95% or more of developable agricultural land\u201d. To guide this vision and goal of the Government the Medium-Term Transport Plan (MTTP) and the National Transport Strategy (NTS) were formulated as a response to the overarching policy direction of Vision 2050, the Development Strategic Plan, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Roads</em></strong></p><p>The roads in PNG have developed around the provincial centers of population, many of which are on the coast and linked nationally by coastal shipping. Local road networks have been developed from these coastal centers, along the coastal plains and upriver-valleys and over mountain passes to penetrate inland. The Highlands Region is landlocked, with the main centers connected by air, and this spurred the development of the Highlands Highway connecting the 7 inland provinces with the coast of PNGs main port of Lae. PNG\u2019s subnational network of provincial and district roads total about 20,000 km and serves 85% of the rural population. However, rural roads often receive fewer financial and technical resources than national roads and many are deteriorating due to neglect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Maritime and Inland Water Transport</em></strong></p><p>The existing policy that controls and regulates the number of coastal vessels trading on specific routes within PNG waters be reviewed with the intention of encouraging competition while maintaining strict controls over safety and security of all PNG registered vessels and monitoring the total number of vessels trading in these waters. The current practice of generally prohibiting overseas vessels from carrying domestic cargoes (carbotage) is also to be reviewed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Civil Aviation</em></strong></p><p>PNG\u2019s aviation industry provides essential support for tourism, business, trade, and social cohesion. However, deteriorating infrastructure and constrained institutional capacity threaten the certification of many of PNG\u2019s airports. The Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s development plan provides a framework for addressing existing gaps, but the agency requires technical and financial support to implement them successfully. In support of the 2009 Ministerial Policy statement, the Civil Aviation Policy 2000 was prepared at the time of legislative changes in the sector, that gave rise to the Civil Aviation Act 2000. The Act endorses an \u201copen skies\u201d policy of full competition on all domestic routes being permitted to use aircraft of one\u2019s choice on these routes, subject to safety and airport capacity and capability requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Civil Aviation Investment Program was approved in December 2009 to address critical constraints. It comprises of a total of four tranches, with a total funding allocation of approximately $480 million. The investment program is overseeing upgrades to nineteen (19) priority national airports, supporting institutional reforms, and building public and private sector capacity, to ensure the long-term maintenance of all corresponding infrastructure. Activities completed under tranche 1 helped ensure compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization safety and security standards for five priority airports identified under the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s strategic plan. Tranche 1 included (i) institutional reforms to improve air traffic services and regulatory oversights; (ii) physical works; (iii) modernization of communication, navigation, surveillance, and fire safety authority. Tranche 2 includes (i) institutional strengthening to increase the sustainability of the reformed institutions, including the National Airports Corporation, Air Services Limited, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority; physical works; and procurement of equipment for communication, surveillance, and fire safety. Tranche 3 includes (i) institutional strengthening to increase the sustainability of the National Airports Corporation, Air Services Limited, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority; (ii) physical works; and (iii) procurement of equipment for communication, surveillance, and fire safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Upon completion in 2019 the Civil Aviation Development Investment Program will have built or upgraded a total of thirteen (13) airport terminals and landside facilities; improved runways; taxiways and airside facilities at fifteen (15) airports; and helped secure certification from the International Civil Aviation Organization for Jackson\u2019s International Airport. In line with the national priorities and the successful implementation of the investment program, the government has requested further investment in aviation infrastructure and corresponding support to build institutional capacity.</p><p>The transport policy will continue to be one of liberalization, recognizing that restrictions on market entry can reduce incentives for cost efficiency through lack of competition, excessive profit margins and high prices. Apart from situations where there is a need for certainty and stability of service provision, the Government will not regulate market entry on the routes and traffic to be carried by domestic transport operators. The Government will only regulate for safe operation, safe quality and fair pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Investment Opportunities</strong></p><p>In summary it can be seen that in the maritime subsector the carbotage issue, a practice in which overseas vessels are prohibited from carrying domestic cargoes, is under review. Depending on the outcome of the review there is scope for further strengthening through investment opportunities.</p><p>In the air transport sector, the domestic routes are open so long as compliance requirements are adhered to such as safety and airport capacity and capabilities. With the success of ADB\u2019s intervention in development assistance, it can be seen that there is scope for future donor funding initiatives with the government requesting further investment in aviation infrastructure including corresponding support. This means that there is opportunity for future investments in these sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Sector Profile in PNG</strong></p><p>The Information Communication Technologies (ICT) sector, for more than a decade had been inward-looking until three major policy initiatives and decisions were taken by the State. The introduction of mobile services; the implementation of the Competition Act in March 2007; and the formulation of the National Information Communication Technology Policy. With the finalization of the ICT Policy in 2008, the National Information Communications Technology Authority (NICTA) Act was introduced by the Government in 2009, taking on the responsibilities of the Telecommunications Act 1996 and the Radio Spectrum Act 1996. This move resulted in the decommissioning of all roles and functions of the Papua New Guinea Telecommunications Authority (PANGTEL) and transferred to NICTA, with the policy objective of NICTA to regulate the ICT sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With these reforms in place, cheaper prices and stronger competition was experienced in the country and this also ushered in a new generation of innovative services in the business landscape. For instance, when the Irish-based Digicel company entered the local mobile market in 2007, the sector experienced the benefits of increased competition. Mobile call rates (prices) were significantly reduced and there has been an increase in, and expansion of, network coverage to 89 of the country\u2019s population. The innovative services emanating out of the mobile market and network coverage include, but are not limited to, clients of the PNG Power being able to pay for electricity using their mobile phones as well as the local Bank of South Pacific introducing and rolling out internet and banking services to the individuals and business communities, especially those in the rural communities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of a national broadband network, an undersea cable (the Coral Seas Cable System) will be laid between Sydney (Australia) and Port Moresby (PNG) and onward to Solomon Islands. It is a project funded by the Australian Government on two thirds one third basis, and only applies to the Sydney hub to Port Moresby (and to Solomon Islands). The project is valued at PGK 324 million (A$136 million) and has a technical maximum capacity of 10 terabytes per second, which is about 1000 times the current capacity. The domestic internet network will be built by China\u2019s Huawei company, which will connect the undersea cable running between Port Moresby, Alotau, Popondetta, Lae and Madang provinces. After completion, the cable system will be owned by both the PNG and Solomon Island Governments, respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Investment Opportunities</strong></p><p>There is a need for investment in the ICT sector to reduce the rates of connection to the internet, which range from K15 to K30 per hour.</p><p>2G still exists in many rural and remote areas, with 3G and 4G LTE centered more on urban areas. Hence there is a need to provide enhanced access to the interne to the bulk of the population in the rural areas.</p><p>Internet access is expected to improve with the 2018 build-out of a new submarine cable known as the Coral Sea Cable System which will link PNG to the Solomon Islands, with a connecting cable to the Australian (Sydney) landing station. It is expected to provide increased capacity and reliability as well as reduce Internet costs for consumers. Investors in the commercial telecommunications services would be desirable to help realize the full potential of this new submarine cable.</p><p>There is also an opportunity for investment in Kumul Telikom to revamp their communication services on NGN and also for NICTA to regulate the licenses/spectrum to protect PNG\u2019s asset from internal and external attacks. This would result in reduction in cost of service and improvement in quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",
