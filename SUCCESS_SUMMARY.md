## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. View Your Backup Data

```bash
# List all backups
ls -lh backups/

# View backup metadata
cat backups/auth_backup_20251004_061742/metadata.json

# View user data (formatted)
cat backups/auth_backup_20251004_061742/auth_users.json | python3 -m json.tool | less
```

### 2. Create More Backups

```bash
# Backup auth users again
python3 backup_auth_only.py

# Once database is accessible, full backup:
python3 cli.py backup
```

### 3. Test Restore (Careful!)

```bash
# View restore options
python3 cli.py restore --help

# Restore would work like this (DON'T RUN without testing environment):
# python3 cli.py restore ./backups/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

### 4. Automate Backups

```bash
# Add to crontab for daily backups
crontab -e

# Add this line for daily auth backup at 2 AM:
0 2 * * * cd /Users/benjaminirani/Desktop/dev/supapy && python3 backup_auth_only.py
```

### 5. Fix Database Connection

**Check your Supabase dashboard:**
1. Go to [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Check if project is **paused** (unpause it)
4. Verify database connection string in Settings → Database
5. Once active, run: `python3 test_connection.py`
